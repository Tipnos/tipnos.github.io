## Who am I?

{{< figure class="floatleft" src="images/me.jpg" width="180" >}} 

I am a software engineer driven by achievements. An enthusiast teammate who loves building software and pushing projects forward. Thanks to this mindset, I also participated in entrepreneurship adventures and enjoyed product and management positions. My interests, initially focused on software engineering, have grown along the way: system engineering, strategy, business and management.

I’m currently working for the cloud provider [3DS Outscale](https://fr.outscale.com/) in a team whose goal is developing a disruptive version of an IAM (Identity and Access Management). On the menu: distributed authorization with [Biscuit token](https://www.biscuitsec.org/) and only one authentication system per user, with uncorrelated tenants.

## What is this site?

A place to keep my own writings. The articles cover a broad range of software development topics, from technical tutorial to software team management. I prioritize subjects that seem little covered or which I can address with an original vision. Additionally, I might also write about my hobbies: guitar improvisation, sailing, video games… But not too often to keep time for practice!

## To learn about new posts

The best source is the site's [RSS Feed](/index.xml) which you can subscribe to with any RSS reader. My articles are not "advertised" on social medias because their purpose/style doesn't suit well with them. I prefer relying on search engines or post on forums with an interest on the article subject.
  
## History

I grew up in Toulouse, France. I went to Polytech Montpellier from 2010-4 where I got a MEng in Computer Science and Microelectronics. After graduating, I came back to Toulouse working as a developer on the [warehouse management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse_management_system) of an e-commerce thrid-party [logistics company](https://lemans.e-logik.fr/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwx-CyBhAqEiwAeOcTdTXp0g8Zo0NWolLNqNd3LeL6YCoz6BhppcTP-vhq6uxnT-9uS0fjKhoCAMoQAvD_BwE). 

Two years later, I took the opportunity to create a video game start-up, with business partners. I learned a lot about entrepreneurship and autonomy.

Then I moved to Paris and joined [Neqo](https://www.neqo.eu/), a corporate start-up, several months after its creation, as a technical lead. In three years, I assembled a team of five developers and managed them to create two business intelligence SaaS applications, used by procurement departments of large companies and administrations.

I quit Neqo to combine passion and work as a game developer freelancer. I mainly worked on a personal project: a [PVP multiplayer video game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAhIvJ0JPc). Due to the difficulty of finding funds and interesting missions, I resigned myself and looked for a new, exciting project.

That’s how I joined the cloud provider industry by integrating Outscale in 2023. I’m really glad I found a project with exciting challenges and a great team where I’m not confined in a limited role.

I'm currently living in Rennes, France, working partially remotely.
